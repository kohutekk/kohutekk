
1) What is the difference between stronly and loosely typed programming languages? 
Give an example of a language that falls into each category.
   A strongly typed programming language is one that already has predefined types of
data for all of the variable, and can be easliy manipulated. Loosely typed programming 
languages require you to define each variable with the data type normally at the beginning
of the program. An example of a strongly typed program is Perl, Ruby, and Python. While 
Java and all of the C programs are considered a loosely typed programming languages.

2)What is the difference between stacks and queues?
   Stacks is where you would add and subtract from the end of the pile (aka the last
variable you entered in) and queues takes from the top of the pile(aka the first 
variable that you entered in).


3)What 3 things do you need to do to control a loop in most programming languages?
   Set, Test, and Change

4)What is the diffference between compiled and interpreted programming languages?
Give an example of a language that falls into each category.
   Compiled is where the computer looks at the entire program at once where an interpreted
is where the computer does it line by line. Perl is a interppreted. Java is kinda both. 
C++ is a compiled.
