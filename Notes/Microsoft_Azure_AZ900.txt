Microsoft Azure A-Z 900 Certification Notes:

-------------- CLOUD CONCEPTS --------------
What is Cloud Computing...
    - Cloud Computing - a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data. (Rather than a local server or a PC)
        - Cloud Providers - you are only responsible for configuring cloud services, and code while someone else takes care of the servers, hiring IT, paying the real-estate.
    - Dedicated server - one host, one machine, one vpn
        - Expensive, high maintenance, high security
    - Virtual Private Server - one host, one machine, multiple vpn
    - Shared Hosting - multiple host, one machine, multiple vpn
        - Cheap, limited
    - Cloud Hosting - Multiple hosts, multiple machines, multiple vpn
        - Scalable, Secure, Cost-Effective, High Configurability

Common Cloud Services...
    4 most common types of cloud services for Infractructure as a service (IaaS) would be:
        - Compute - virtual comp that runs applications, programs and code
        - Storage - virtual hard-drive that stores files
        - Networking - virtual network that defines internet connections and network isolations
        - Databases - virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose
        
What is Microsoft...
    - Microsoft - American computer technology corportation; makes software, phones, tablets, game consoles, cloud services, search engine and more; best known for their Operation System
    - Microsoft Azure - the cloud provider service microsoft provides; bright blue color of the cloudless sky 
    - CSPs - Cloud Service Providers
    
Benefits of Cloud Computing...
    Cost-effective - pay for what you consume; no up-front cost; pay as you go (PAYG)
    Global - launch from anywhere in the world
    Secure - cloud services can by secure by default
    Reliable - data backup, disaster reconvery, and data replication, and fault tolerance
    Scalable - can increase or decrease resources and services based on demand
    Elastic - Automate scaling during spikes or drop in demand
    Current - fewer interupptions then on ground (aka if you are updating or updgrading hardware and software)
    
Types of Cloud Computing...
    - SaaS Software as a Service - a product that is runned and managed by a service provider (for customers); no maintanance, it just workds and remains availible; salesforce, gmail, office 365
    - Paas Platform as a service - focus on deployment and management of apps; no worries about provisioning, configuring or understanding he hardware or OS; heroku, elastic beanstalk, google app engine
    - IaaS Infustructure as a Service - basic building blocks of the coud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers, and data storage space; Microsoft Azure, AWS, Oracle
    
Types of Cloud Computing Responsibilities... 
    - On-Premise - 
        - Customer is Responsible for everything
    - Infrastructure as a service - 
        - Customer is responsible - Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, and OS
        - CSP is responsible - Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking
    - Platform as a Service - 
        - Customer is responsible - Applications, and Data
        - CSP is responsible - Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking
    - Software as a Service - CSP is responsible for everything 
    
Cloud Deployment Models...
Azure's Deployment Models... 
    - Public Cloud (Coud-Native) - Everything is built on the Cloud Provider
    - Private Cloud (On-Primise) - Everything is built on company's datacenters; OpenStack
    - Hybrid - Uses both On--Primise and Cloud Service Provider
    - Cross-Cloud - Using Multiple Cloud Providers; hybride-cloud (Azure Arc)

Total Ownership...
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)...
    - On-Premise - Software license fee; Implementation, Configuration, Training...Physical Security, Hardware, IT Personal, and Maintenance
    - Azure - Subscription fee;  Implementation, Configuration, Training
    - Azure can save around 75% money
    
Capital vs Operational Expenditure...
    - Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) - Spending money upfront; Server, Storage, Networks, Backup and Archive, Disaster Recovery, Datacenter Costs, and Technical Personal; it's a guessing game
    - Operational Expenditure (OPEX) - non-pysical costs with a service provider; Leasing Software and Customizing features, Training Employees in Cloud Services, Paying for Cloud Support, and Billing based on cloud metrics eg. compute and storage usage; can try products without investing in the equiptment. 
    
Cloud Architecture Terminologies...
    - Availability - ensure a service remains available; High Available (HA)
    - Scalability - ability to grow rapidly or unimpeded
    - Elasticity - ability to shrink or grow to meet the demand
    - Fault Tolerance - ability to prevent a failure 
    - Disaster Recovery - ability to recover from failure; Highly Durable (DR)
    
HA (High Availability)...
    - Ability for the service to remain availible by ensuring there is no single point of failure!; Running through multiple Availability Zones ensures that if 1 or 2 AZs becone unvailable, the service remains available
    - Azure Load Balancer - evenly distributes traffic to multiple servers. if datacenter becomes unavailable the load balancer will rout the traffic to availble datacenters

High Scalability...
    - Increase the capacity based on the increasing demand of traffic, memory and computing power
    - Vertical Scaling - Upgrade to a bigger server
    - Horizonal Scaling - Add more servers of the same size
    
High Elasticity...
    - Automatically increase or decrease the capacity based on the current demand of traffic, memory, and computing power
    - Horizonal Scaling - 
        - Scaling out - adding more servers of same size
        - Scaling in - removing more servers of the same size 
    - Azure VM Scale Set - responds to demand or a defines schedule to increase or decrease
    - SQL Server Stretch Database - stretch warm and cold transactional data from Microsoft SQL Server 2016 to Azure
    - Vertical CSaling is hard for traditional architecture. 
    
Fault Tolerance...
High Durability...
    - ability to recover from a disaster to present the loss of data; Disaster Recovery (DR)
        - Do you have a backup
        - How fast can you restore that backup
        - Does your backup still work
        - How do you ensure current live data is not corrupt


-------------- EVOLUTION OF COMPUTING  --------------
Dedicated Services...
    Dedicated - physical server wholly utilized by a single customer; overpay for an underutilitzed server; Upgrading beyond your Operating System is slow and expensive; multiple apps can be conflicts in resource sharing; guarantee of security, privacy and full utility of underlying resources
    
Virtual Machines...
    VMs - run multiple VMs on one machine; hypervisor is VM software; shared by multiple customers; paying for a fraction of the server; overpay and underutilized; limited by guest operating system; less conflicts but still an issue
    
Containers...
    Containers - VMs can run multiple containers; Docker Deamon - software layer that runs containers; more cost effective with using the maximum space; containers share the same base OS so more efficient then multiple VMs; Doen't have any conflicts bc running different copies of the OS within the VM
    
 Functions...
    Function - Serverless COmpute - VMs running managed containers; you upload the amount of memory and duration; only responsible for code, and data; very cost-effective; VMs only run when there is code to be executed. 
    Cold Starts - wait to start before the code exicutes
    
-------------- Global Infrastructure --------------
Regions and Geographies...
    Region - grouping of multiple datacenters (Availability Zones)
        - Azure has 58 Regions across 140 Contries
    Geography - 2 or more regions that preserves data residency and compliance bounarties.
    
Paired Region...
    Each region is paired with another 300 mils away to ensure no outages for disaster recovery
    Azure Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) - replicates the data to the secondary region automatically wo ensure the data is durable during an event
    
 Region Types and Service Availability...
    Not all Azure cloud services are available in every region
    Recommended region - designed to support availability zone; provides tht broadest range of service capabilities
    Alternate (Other) region - not designed to support AZ. 
    General Availibility (GA) - when a service is considered ready to be used pubilicaly
    Azure cloud services categories:
        - Foundational - GA immediately or in 12months in recommended and alternate regions
        - Mainstream - GA immediately or in 12 months in recommended regions (May become available in Alternate regions based on customer demand)
        - Specialized - avalible in recommended or alternate region based on cunsumer demand
 
Special Regions...
    Azure has specialized regions to meet compliance or legal reasons

Avalibility Zones (AZ)...
    AZ - is a physiscal location made up of one or more datacenter
    datacenter - secured building that contains hundreds of thousands of computers; isolated from each other but close enough to provide low-latency
    regions genreally contains 3 AZ; to ensure servers have backup for High Availbility 
    
AZ Supported Regions...
    Alternate or Other Regions - doesn't have support for Availability Zones; recommended to have 3AZ

Fault and Update Domains...
    AZ - combonation of a fault domain and an update domain
    Fault Domain - hardware to avaiod a single point of failure within an AZ
    Update Domain - When updating this domain ensures your resources do not go offline
    Availability Set- logiacal grouping to ensure the VMs have different fault/update domains to aviod downtime.
