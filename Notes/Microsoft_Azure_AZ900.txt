Microsoft Azure A-Z 900 Certification Notes:

----Describe cloud concepts (25–30%)----
Describe cloud computing
    define cloud computing
        - a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data. (Rather than a local server or a PC)
        - Cloud Providers - are only responsible for configuring cloud services, and code while someone else takes care of the servers, hiring IT, paying the real-estate.
    describe the shared responsibility model
        - Image attached to folder
    define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid
        - Public Cloud (Coud-Native) - Everything is built on the Cloud Provider
        - Private Cloud (On-Premise) - Everything is built on company's data centers; OpenStack
        - Hybrid - Uses both On--Premise and Cloud Service Provider
        - Cross-Cloud - Using Multiple Cloud Providers; hybrid-cloud (Azure Arc)
    identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model
    describe the consumption-based model
    compare cloud pricing models

Describe the benefits of using cloud services
    describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud
        - HA 
            - Ability for the service to remain available by ensuring there is no single point of failure!; Running through multiple Availability Zones ensures that if 1 or 2 AZs become unavailable, the service remains available
            - Azure Load Balancer - evenly distributes traffic to multiple servers. if datacenter becomes unavailable the load balancer will route the traffic to available data centers
        - High Scalability
            - Increase the capacity based on the increasing demand of traffic, memory and computing power
            - Vertical Scaling - Upgrade to a bigger server
            - Horizontal Scaling - Add more servers of the same size
    describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud
        - Reliable 
            - data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication, and fault tolerance
   
describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud
describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud

Describe cloud service types
describe infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
basic building blocks of cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers, and data storage space; Microsoft Azure, AWS, Oracle
Compute - virtual comp that runs applications, programs and code
Storage - virtual hard-drive that stores files
Networking - virtual network that defines internet connections and network isolations
Databases - virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose
describe platform as a service (PaaS)
focus on deployment and management of apps; no worries about provisioning, configuring or understanding he hardware or OS; heroku, elastic beanstalk, google app engine
describe software as a service (SaaS)
a product that is runned and managed by a service provider (for customers); no maintenance, it just works and remains available; salesforce, gmail, office 365
identify appropriate use cases for each cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)


Describe Azure architecture and services (35–40%)
Describe the core architectural components of Azure
describe Azure regional, regional pairs, and sovereign regions
describe availability zones
is a physical location made up of one or more datacenter 
regions generally contains 3 AZ; to ensure servers have backup for High Availability 
describe Azure datacenters
secured building that contains hundreds of thousands of computers; isolated from each other but close enough to provide low-latency
describe Azure resources and resource groups
describe subscriptions
describe management groups
describe the hierarchy of resource groups, subscriptions, and management groups

Describe Azure compute and networking services
compare compute types, including container instances, virtual machines (VMs), and functions
describe VM options, including Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, availability sets, and Azure Virtual Desktop
describe resources required for virtual machines
run multiple VMs on one machine; hypervisor is VM software; shared by multiple customers; paying for a fraction of the server; overpay and underutilized; limited by guest operating system; less conflicts but still an issue
describe application hosting options, including the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service, containers, and virtual machines
describe virtual networking, including the purpose of Azure Virtual Networks, Azure virtual subnets, peering, Azure DNS, Azure VPN Gateway, and Azure ExpressRoute
define public and private endpoints

Describe Azure storage services
compare Azure storage services
Blob storage - Object serverless storage; store loarge files and loarge amounts of files; you pary for what you store, unlimited storage, no-resizing volumes and filesystem protocol
Dick Storage - virtual volume; SSD or HDD encryption by default, attached volume to VMs
File Storage - volume you can access and manage like a gile server 
Queue Storage - Messaging Queue; store queuing and reliably delivering messages between applications
Table Storage - Wide-Column NoSQL Database; hosts unstructured data independent any schema
Data box (heavy) - rugged briefcase computer and storage designed to move terabytes or petabytes of data
Archive storage - long term cold storage to hold onto files for years for cheap
Data Lake Storage - store all structured and unstructured data at any scale
describe storage tiers
describe redundancy options
describe storage account options and storage types
identify options for moving files, including AzCopy, Azure Storage Explorer, and Azure File Sync
describe migration options, including Azure Migrate and Azure Data Box Describe Azure identity, access, and security
DB Migration Service - migrates your DB to cloud with no application code changes
Data box (heavy) - rugged briefcase computer and storage designed to move terabytes or petabytes of data
describe directory services in Azure, including Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS)
describe authentication methods in Azure, including single sign-on (SSO), multi factor authentication, and passwordless
describe external identities and guest access in Azure
describe Azure AD Conditional Access
describe Azure role-based access control (RBAC)
describe the concept of Zero Trust
describe the purpose of the defense in depth model
Describe the purpose of Microsoft Defender for Cloud


Describe Azure management and governance (30–35%)
Describe cost management in Azure
describe factors that can affect costs in Azure
compare the Pricing calculator and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator
describe the Azure Cost Management and Billing tool
describe the purpose of tags

Describe features and tools in Azure for governance and compliance
describe the purpose of Azure Blueprints
describe the purpose of Azure Policy
describe the purpose of resource locks
describe the purpose of the Service Trust Portal

Describe features and tools for managing and deploying Azure resources
describe the Azure portal
describe Azure Cloud Shell, including Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell
describe the purpose of Azure Arc
describe Azure Resource Manager and Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates)

Describe monitoring tools in Azure
describe the purpose of Azure Advisor
describe Azure Service Health
describe Azure Monitor, including Log Analytics, Azure Monitor alerts, and Application Insights
