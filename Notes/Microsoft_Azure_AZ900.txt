Microsoft Azure A-Z 900 Certification Notes:

What is Cloud Computing...
    Cloud Computing - a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data. (Rather than a local server or a PC)
        Cloud Providers - you are only responsible for configuring cloud services, and code while someone else takes care of the servers, hiring IT, paying the real-estate.
  
    Dedicated server - one host, one machine, one vpn
        Expensive, high maintenance, high security
    Virtual Private Server - one host, one machine, multiple vpn
    Shared Hosting - multiple host, one machine, multiple vpn
        Cheap, limited
    Cloud Hosting - Multiple hosts, multiple machines, multiple vpn
        Scalable, Secure, Cost-Effective, High Configurability

Common Cloud Services...
    4 most common types of cloud services for Infractructure as a service (IaaS) would be:
        Compute - virtual comp that runs applications, programs and code
        Storage - virtual hard-drive that stores files
        Networking - virtual network that defines internet connections and network isolations
        Databases - virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose
        
What is Microsoft...
    Microsoft - American computer technology corportation; makes software, phones, tablets, game consoles, cloud services, search engine and more; best known for their Operation System
    Microsoft Azure - the cloud provider service microsoft provides; bright blue color of the cloudless sky 
    CSPs - Cloud Service Providers
    
Benefits of Cloud Computing...
    Cost-effective - pay for what you consume; no up-front cost; pay as you go (PAYG)
    Global - launch from anywhere in the world
    Secure - cloud services can by secure by default
    Reliable - data backup, disaster reconvery, and data replication, and fault tolerance
    Scalable - can increase or decrease resources and services based on demand
    Elastic - Automate scaling during spikes or drop in demand
    Current - fewer interupptions then on ground (aka if you are updating or updgrading hardware and software)
    
Types of Cloud Computing...
    SaaS Software as a Service - a product that is runned and managed by a service provider (for customers); no maintanance, it just workds and remains availible; salesforce, gmail, office 365
    Paas Platform as a service - focus on deployment and management of apps; no worries about provisioning, configuring or understanding he hardware or OS; heroku, elastic beanstalk, google app engine
    IaaS Infustructure as a Service - basic building blocks of the coud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers, and data storage space; Microsoft Azure, AWS, Oracle
    
Types of Cloud Computing Responsibilities... 
    On-Premise - 
        Customer is Responsible for everything
    Infrastructure as a service - 
        Customer is responsible - Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, and OS
        CSP is responsible - Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking
    Platform as a Service - 
        Customer is responsible - Applications, and Data
        CSP is responsible - Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, and Networking
    Software as a Service - CSP is responsible for everything 
    
Cloud Deployment Models...
Azure's Deployment Models... 
    Public Cloud (Coud-Native) - Everything is built on the Cloud Provider
    Private Cloud (On-Primise) - Everything is built on company's datacenters; OpenStack
    Hybrid - Uses both On--Primise and Cloud Service Provider
Cross-Cloud - Using Multiple Cloud Providers; hybride-cloud (Azure Arc)

Total Ownership...
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)...
    On-Premise - Software license fee; Implementation, Configuration, Training...Physical Security, Hardware, IT Personal, and Maintenance
    Azure - Subscription fee;  Implementation, Configuration, Training
    Azure can save around 75% money
    
Capital vs Operational Expenditure...
